### 2. Second on your MacOS sytem you should install SWIFT development enviorment called XCode, which come together with an IOS device simulator, that will be used to run the application.
 
> To download the XCode IDE, head to the application called AppStore. In the search bar, search for the Xcode 
> and hit the download button. XCode is really large applications, so you should wait a bit before it finnishes installing.
