## How to make the application run on your system. 

> 1. First you should clone the repository on your machine using the url that is provided by github.
> You can do so either by cloning it with terminal or a GitHub desktop tool. 

> 2. Second on your MacOS sytem you should install SWIFT development enviorment called XCode, which come 
> together with an IOS device simulator, that will be used to run the application.\

> To download the XCode IDE, head to the application called AppStore. In the search bar, search for the Xcode 
> and hit the download button. XCode is really large applications, so you should wait a bit before it finnishes installing. 

> After the installation, make sure that you have installed the latest Xcode version.

> 3. Now that you have downloaded Xcode on your MacOs machine, you can open it in your applications folder or tab.

> Next after opening the application, select the option to open a project or a file. 
> After that navigate towards a recently cloned application folder and open it.

> 4. Next, as shown in the image, navigate toward the launch option of the application.

>This is a menu in the XCode where you can select which type of the IOS device, should the simulator simulate.
>Because I was testing the code on the Iphone SE 2nd, I want to you to set up your simulator to simualte the
>Iphone SE 2nd generation. 

>After selectiong the version of the simulator, you can either hit *CMD + R* or press the Play button right next to the 
>device selector to run application. This will build the application and launch a simulator app on your MacOs device, 
>with the application already running on it. 

>If ypu have performed all steps correctly you can now use and test my application.
